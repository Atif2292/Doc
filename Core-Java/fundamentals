----What is an object in Java----
===========================

1- An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object.
2- An object has three characteristics:
State: represents the data (value) of an object.(variable)
Behavior: represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit,
withdraw, etc.
Identity: An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID.

===========================
---What is an Class in Java---
===========================

1- A class is a group of objects which have common properties.
2- It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.
3- It is a logical entity and It can't be physical.
4-Class ke andr state and behavior hota hain state variable define
   krte hain aur behaviour method ko.

             -------- A class in Java can contain: --------

                        1-  Fields
                        2-  Methods
                        3-  Constructors
                        4-  Blocks
                        5-  Nested class and interface

**************************
Syntax to declare a class:

    class <class_name>{
    fields;
    method;
      }

====================
Java static keyword
====================

1-The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly.
2-We can apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes.

NOTE: Java static property is shared to all objects.


3-The static variable can be used to refer to the common property of all objects
(which is not unique for each object), for example, the company name of employees,
 college name of students, etc.

4-The static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class
loading.

===================
Java Variables
====================

1-A variable is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed.
2)Static variables assigned with a data type.
3-Variable is a name of memory location.
4-There are three types of variables in java: local, instance and static.

There are two types of data types in Java: primitive and non-primitive.

1) Local Variable:A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable.
 You can use this variable only within that method and the other methods in the class aren't
 even aware that the variable exists.


2) Instance Variable:A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method,
 is called an instance variable. It is not declared as static.

3) Static variable: A variable that is declared as static is called a static variable.
It cannot be local. You can create a single copy of the static variable and share it
among all the instances of the class.
Memory allocation for static variables happens only once when the class is loaded in the memory.



====================
Java final variable
====================

If you make any variable as final, you cannot change the value of final variable.

===================
COMMAND STATEMENTS
===================

-------------
For loop
------------

for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++) [length is the property of array]
i++ indicates the increment and i-- indicates the decrement,
i<a is a condition ,
int i=0 This part is initialization.
