======================
Inheritance in Java
======================

1)Class: A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template
or blueprint from which objects are created.

2)Sub Class/Child Class: Subclass is a class which inherits the other class.
 It is also called a derived class, extended class, or child class.

3)Super Class/Parent Class: Superclass is the class from where a subclass inherits
 the features. It is also called a base class or a parent class.

4)Reusability: As the name specifies, reusability is a mechanism which facilitates
 you to reuse the fields and methods of the existing class when you create a new class.
  You can use the same fields and methods already defined in the previous class.

NOTE:ek class sirf ek class ko extend kr skte aur multiple class ko implement kr
skte hn.

NOTE:ek contract ke multiple implementation ho skta  hain. Par ek class ke Multiple
extend nahi ho skta.

*******************************
The syntax of Java Inheritance
*******************************

      class Subclass-name extends Superclass-name
      {
         //methods and fields
      }

Note: Multiple inheritance is not supported in Java through class.

# On the basis of class, there can be three types of inheritance in java: single,
 multilevel and hierarchical.

********* Single Inheritance Example***************

When  When a class inherits another class, it is known as a single inheritance.
a class inherits another class, it is known as a single inheritance.
In the example given below, Dog class inherits the Animal class,
so there is the single inheritance.

######################################################
SYNTEXT-
class Animal{
void eat(){System.out.println("eating...");}
}
class Dog extends Animal{
void bark(){System.out.println("barking...");}
}

**************Hierarchical Inheritance Example************

When two or more classes inherits a single class, it is known as hierarchical inheritance.
In the example given below, Dog and Cat classes inherits the Animal class, so there is
hierarchical inheritance.

*************Multilevel Inheritance Example***********

When there is a chain of inheritance, it is known as multilevel inheritance.
As you can see in the example given below, BabyDog class inherits the Dog class
which again inherits the Animal class, so there is a multilevel inheritance.
