Interface in Java
======================

1)There can be only abstract method in the JAVA interface,not method body.
2)It is use to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in JAVA.
3)In other words,you can say that interface can  have abstract method and variables.
4)It cannot have a method body.
5)It can not be instantiated just like the abstract class.

Syntax:

    interface <interface_name>{

        // declare constant fields
        // declare methods that abstract
        // by default.
}
