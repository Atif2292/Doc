Introduction
---
The main objective of constructor is to perform initialization of an object.

---
  Rules to write constructors:
---
1. Name of the constructor and name of the class must be same.
2. Return type concept is not applicable for constructor even void also by mistake if
we are declaring the return type for the constructor we won't get any compile
time error and runtime error compiler simply treats it as a method.
3.It is legal (but stupid) to have a method whose name is exactly same as class
name.
4.The only applicable modifiers for the constructors are public, default, private,
protected.
5. If we are using any other modifier we will get compile time error.


Class mein Constructor bhi hote hain object/Instance aur method ki alawa.

Rules for creating Java constructor
-------------------------------------

1)Constructor name must be the same as its class name
2)A Constructor must have no explicit return type
3)A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized

Rule: If there is no constructor in a class, compiler automatically creates a
default constructor.
 USE: A constructor is used to initialize the state of an object.
---------------------------
Types of Java constructors
---------------------------

There are two types of constructors in Java:

1)Parameterized constructor : A constructor which has a specific number
of parameters is called a parameterized constructor
2)Default constructor(no-arg constructor): A constructor is called "Default Constructor"
when it doesn't have any parameter.

SYNTEXT-

public <classname>(){
  }
 Basically jab ham object banata new se tab uske age jo hm class ka name likhte hn vahi
 CONSTRUCTOR hain. for eg - product obj = new product(); isme product constructor hain.
