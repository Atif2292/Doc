Stack is LIFO(Last In Fast Out):
In Stack when input a value through push method it is added in the Datastructure
of array and we can remove it through a method of pop. In this the first/last stack
trace fill first/last and last/first stack trace remove last/first

Queue is FIFO (First In First Out) :In Queue when input a value through push
method it is added in the Datastructure of array and we can remove it through a
method of pop. isme pehle jo bhara jayga wahi sbse pehle niklega stack trace se.
