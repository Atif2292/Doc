---------------
Abstract class
----------------

  1)  An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
  2)  It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
  3)  It cannot be instantiated. - It means ki Object/Instance nahi ban skta.
  4)  It can have constructors and static methods also.
  5)  It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the
  body of the method.

NOTE 1: Basically ek contraction hota hain kyuki isme hme return type nahi dena hota hain
as compared to method.Isme hame sirf method declaration  likhne hoti hn Isme body nahi hoti-
 for eg. public abstract int addition(int no.01, int no.02).

NOTE 2: Ek abstract class ke andr he abstract method valid ho skta hain.
